                <h1>About Project</h1>
                <p>
                    Mail Delivery is a racing arcade game  summited for Epic Mega Jam 2020. It was developed using Unreal Engine Blueprints.  This was my second game jam.
                    <br><br>
                    The team consisted of 7 people, Producer, Audio (2), Artist (2) and Programmers (2). Our purpose as a team is to gather to make multiple games and learn together 
                    as a team while making projects just like this for our portfolio! This was our first project together! 
                    <br><br>
                    Team Size: Alone/Solo<br>
                    Tools Used: Unreal Engine, Blender<br>
                    Languages: Unreal Engine Blueprints<br>
                    Project Duration: A week (7 Days)<br>
                </p>
                <h1>Development:</h1>
                <p>
                    The theme for this Game Jam was "It's been a long time, but we're not done yet." I remember being in college and struggling to come up with ideas related to this
                    topic. Eventually, I thought about the concept of "doing something for a long time, but having to repeat it." That's when the idea of a mail delivery game came
                    to mind, inspired by the challenges faced by mail delivery workers during the busy Christmas season. The goal was to deliver packages and postal cards as
                    quickly as possible without receiving any complaints. Although the game was simple and had some bugs and glitches, I learned a lot from it, especially the
                    basics of Unreal Engine 4. I wanted the truck in the game to have an arcade racing game feel, so I watched a developer explain how to create a car controller
                    using just a sphere collider and applying force with physics. I recreated that mechanic in Unreal Engine 4, and it was a fun experience.
                </p>

                <h1>Takeaway</h1>
                <p>
                    This little game holds a special place in my heart as it was created during my college years. Although it is simple and not the best game out there, 
                    I'm proud of what I accomplished, especially considering it was made during a Game Jam while I was still in college. Developing this game taught me 
                    valuable skills such as time management and working under pressure. Sometimes, I find myself thinking about this game and considering the possibility of 
                    remaking it in a more polished and refined manner. Perhaps in the future, with more experience under my belt, I can revisit this project and create a remake 
                    that truly does justice to the original concept.
